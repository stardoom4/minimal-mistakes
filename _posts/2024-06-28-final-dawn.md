In twilight's hush, the world breathes deep,
A whisper on the lips of sleep,
Mountains tall and oceans wide,
Now secrets in the shadows hide.

Once vibrant greens and skies so blue,
Fade to a melancholy hue,
Stars above in silent weep,
As dreams dissolve in endless sleep.

Echoes of laughter, songs of old,
In whispers now, their tales retold,
No more the dance of joy and cheer,
Just memories that linger here.

Cities grand and forests wild,
Once nurtured by the earth so mild,
Cradle now the quiet still,
As time fulfills its final will.

Rivers course with solemn grace,
Through landscapes of a ghostly trace,
Their waters murmur ancient lore,
Of days that shall return no more.

The sun, a fading ember’s glow,
In heavens high begins to slow,
Casting shadows long and deep,
Upon a world that starts to sleep.

The wind, a mourner soft and light,
Sings elegies through day and night,
Caressing all with gentle hand,
As silence spreads across the land.

Creatures of the earth and sky,
In reverence bow, their heads held high,
For they too sense the closing page,
Of nature’s timeless, endless stage.

No clamor now, no fervent beat,
Just stillness in the quiet street,
The pulse of life, a dwindling sigh,
As all prepare to say goodbye.

And yet, within this twilight hour,
A sense of peace, a latent power,
For endings birth beginnings new,
A cycle old, yet always true.

From ashes rise, as stories tell,
A spark, a hope, an ember’s swell,
In cosmic dance, forever spun,
The end is where the start’s begun.

So with this dawn, so soft and gray,
We bid farewell to yesterday,
With heart and soul, we face the night,
And trust in dawn’s returning light.

For though the world may close its eyes,
Beneath new stars, new dreams arise,
And life, in forms unknown, will see,
The endless dawn of eternity.
