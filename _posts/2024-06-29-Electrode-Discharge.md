Electrode potential, also known as redox potential, is a measure of the tendency of a chemical species to gain or lose electrons in an electrochemical reaction. It essentially reflects how easily a species undergoes oxidation (loses electrons) or reduction (gains electrons).  Electrode potential is expressed in volts (V).

There are two main types of electrode potentials:

- **Standard electrode potential (E°):** This is the potential of a half-cell reaction measured under specific standard conditions, which are:
    - Temperature: 25°C (298 K)
    - Pressure: 1 atm (101.3 kPa)
    - Concentration of all solutions: 1 M
    - The standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is assigned a potential of 0 V by convention.
- **Redox potential (E):** This is the potential of an electrode under non-standard conditions.

Electrode potentials are used to predict the spontaneity of redox reactions and to determine the cell potential of electrochemical cells.  A positive electrode potential indicates a tendency for reduction to occur, while a negative electrode potential indicates a tendency for oxidation to occur. The greater the positive value of the electrode potential, the stronger the reducing agent; the more negative the value, the stronger the oxidizing agent.

By comparing the standard electrode potentials of two half-cells, you can predict whether the overall redox reaction will be spontaneous or not. If the potential of the cathode (reduction half-cell) is more positive than the potential of the anode (oxidation half-cell), then the overall reaction will be spontaneous.
